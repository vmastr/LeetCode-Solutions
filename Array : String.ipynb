The loop starts at `i=1` when `j=1` for which we set `nums[j] = nums[i]` and `j=2`, so `nums` remains unchanged. In the next step, `i=2`, `nums[i]==1` and `nums[j-2]==nums[0]==1` so `j` remains unchanged equal to 2. In the next step, `i=3` for which `nums[3] == 2` is not equal to `nums[j] = 1`, hence set `nums[2]=2` and `j=3`. At this point, `nums == [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3]`. The next step is **crucial**. In this step, `i==4` and `j==3`. In addition, `nums[i]==2`, `nums[j]==2` but `nums[i-2]==2`! Meaning that if we were checking for `nums[i]==nums[i-2]` the program would not change the 2 here, and would leave `j=3`. However, `nums[j-2]=1`, since `nums[i] != nums[j-2]`, set `nums[j] = nums [i] = 2` and `j=4`. This gives `nums == [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3]` which is not what we want but now `j=4` which is very crucial for the last step. In the last step, `i==5`, `nums[i]==3` which is not equal to `nums[j-2] == 2`, hence set `nums[j] = nums[i] = 3` and `j=5`. This results in `nums = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]`. "
